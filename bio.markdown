Hi my name is Piotr Kacprzak I was born 1986 in Tarnów, Poland. I started playing 
drums at an early age. As soon as picked up a pair of sticks and hit the drums 
built from cartons boxes, I knew straight away that I would never put those sticks
back down. I began attended private drum lessons and music theory at the age of 14, 
where I learnt how to read notes, work with a metronome as well as being introduced 
to music by drummers.

Where I start interesting in different styles of music funk, fusion, jazz, rock 
and orchestral music. After finishing school I decided that I wanted to continue 
studies with music. So I star study in The School Higher Vocational Education the 
degree awarded bachelor musician teacher. After that I decide to move to Kraków 
where I start study at Jagiellonian University. At this time I study Cultural Management.

drummer, side man, solo artist. At this stage I also had a handful of my own private 
drum students and the more students I had, the more I began to love teaching just as 
much as playing. During all this thinks I don't forget to practise and learn form others 
drummers and participate workshops with drummers Aron Spears, Benny Greb, Harry Tanschek,
